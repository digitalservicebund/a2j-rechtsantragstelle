# 1. Disable console.log

Date: 2024-04-24

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Currently, `console.log` is utilized for logging in our codebase, often left temporarily during development. This occasionally results in unexpected debug logs being committed to the main branch.

To address this, research has been conducted to identify a suitable logger to replace permanent `console.log` instances in our application. The following options have been explored:

1. [Pino](https://getpino.io/#/)
2. [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston#readme)
3. [Log4js-node](https://log4js-node.github.io/log4js-node/)
4. [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan#readme)
5. Keep console.log and integrate eslint to disable it

The pros and cons of these options are described below:

Not maintained anymore, last publish version was 3 years ago <br> 2. Partially customizable, it doesn't have so many options as Pino, Winston and Log4js-node                                  |
| 5) Keep console.log and integrate eslint to disable it | 1. No need to add a new dependency <br> 2. Less work <br> 3. Can be used either in back and front-end                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 1. We are forced to add eslint disabled comments where we need logs <br> 2. We lose NodeJs framework integrations and future possibilities to monitoring our service                              |

## Decision

As a group we decided for the option 5 (`Keep console.log and integrate eslint to disable it`)

- This option requires minimal configuration and is easily implemented.
- Existing infrastructure logs in our Ingress framework allow for monitoring webpage access

While the team is content with this decision, we acknowledge the potential consideration of options 1 and 2 for long-term planning.

## Consequences

- Continued usage of `console.log` in the codebase, supplemented by eslint disabled comments for logging.
- Absence of a robust logger framework may limit integration with Node.js frameworks and impede comprehensive monitoring and alerting for webpage access.
